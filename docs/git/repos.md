## Barebones Starter Mod Kit [Link][7]

Barebones is meant to be a jumping off point for creating a mod with all (or nearly all) of the boilerplate taken care of for you. Barebones sets up the necessary files to create a basic mod (from a scripting persective), allowing you to simply find the places to put your Lua logic in order for you mod to operate. Barebones currently provides limited examples for performing different tasks, and limited examples for unit/ability/item creation. Barebones divides scripts up into several sections: Core Files, Libraries, Examples and Internals.

## GetDotaStats [Link][9]

A huge mess of broken code, with most of it sitting on a server without any version control or fall back. Project run by cowboys that make live changes without testing.
